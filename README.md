- Integration with instant messaging services via webhooks.
- Basic authentication to ensure the security of requests.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK installed on the machine.
- Java IDE (such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) for development.

### Configuration

1. Clone this repository to your local environment:

git clone https://github.com/RodolfoBrandaoOficial/alertGroup.git




2. Open the project in your Java IDE.

3. Configure the basic authentication credentials in the `App.java` file, in the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` variables.

4. Run the project from the `App.java` class.

5. After running the project, the HTTP server will be running on port 3377.

6. Configure a webhook pointing to `http://localhost:3377/webhook` in the instant messaging services (WhatsApp or Telegram).

### Usage
